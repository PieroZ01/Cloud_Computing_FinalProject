## Project Organization

This GitHub repository contains all the materials and codes of my final project for the exam of the **Cloud Computing** course of the **Scientific and Data-Intensive Computing** master degree at *Universit√† degli Studi di Trieste* & *SISSA* (2023-2024).

The project is composed of two parts, each with its own dedicated folder: the **Cloud Basic** part and the **Cloud Advanced** one.

### Cloud Basic Exercise

The exercise consists in the deployment and implementation of a cloud-based file storage system, which I built using [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) and `docker-compose`.

### Cloud Advanced Exercise

This assignment is composed of two exercises, each contained in its own subfolder:

- **Exercise1**: it consists of a replication of the deployment of the service done in the **Cloud Basic** assignment. In this case, the system is deployed using a single-node `kubernetes` cluster.
- **Exercise2**: the request is to deploy and run the [OSU benchmark](https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/) inside two containers distributed in a two-nodes `kubernetes` cluster.


### Further information

The requests and tasks of the exercises can be found in the **Assignments** folder.

More details and explanations are available in the various `README.md` files and above all in the **Report_and_Slides** folder.
